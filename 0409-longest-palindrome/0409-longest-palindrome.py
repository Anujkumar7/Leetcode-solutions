# Idea:
# Start adding letters to a set. If a given letter not in the set, add it. If the given letter is already in the set, remove it from the set.
# If the set isn't empty, you need to return length of the string minus length of the set plus 1.
# Otherwise, you return the length of the string (example 'bb.' Your set is empty, you just return 2).

# Essentially, your set contains non-paired letters. It's one of those bad questions where you need to go over all possible cases and somehow fit them into the
