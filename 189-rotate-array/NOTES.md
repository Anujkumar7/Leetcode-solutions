I have done this code in O(1) Complexity
​
What i have done in this code is I mod the k value with the len of nums so if the last numbers are array can be go to its correct position after MOD
​
and Firstly i rotated the array
and after rotating i start one loop from the 0th index of nums to kth index
and another loop from the kth index to last element of nums
and i definately can call the helper function for all this rotation
